            <p style="border: solid darkslategray;">My name is <u><b>Jose Vargas Figueroa</b></u> and I was born in Puerto Rico, but grew up in <u>New Bedford, Massachusetts</u>. After graduating high school in 2009 I decided to attend <i>Bridgewater State College</i> for Criminal Justice, but I ended up dropping out my second semester to join the <b>Army</b>. I was in for four and a half years as a <b>Forward Observer</b> serving in <u>South Korea</u>, <u>Fort Campbell, Kentucky</u>, and a tour in <u>Afghanistan</u>. After I got out I was all over the place, starting at <i>Westfield State University</i>, moving back to my home town and erecting scaffolds, to obtaining my Class A CDL and driving trucks for a little bit. While driving trucks I almost had my left arm torn off by falling off the top of the truck and it getting caught on the side of it. A few months later, my wife and I, bought a house in Pascoag, Rhode Island which was now an hour away from my truck driving job. I ended up quitting the job and a couple of months before the start of the semester I decided to attend <i>NEIT</i> to major in Software Engineering. I enjoy learning about new technology, understanding how things work, and hope to eventually work partly remotely writing up code. On my free time I enjoy having <strong>cookouts, family events, fishing, hunting, video games</strong>, and spending time with my <em>wife</em>.</p>
